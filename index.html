                  <p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>
                  <p>The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.</p>
                  <p>The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.</p>

                  <p class="funParagraph">   The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.</p>

                  <p>A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.</p>
                  <p>"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."</p>
                  <p>The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.</p>
                  <p>Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.</p>
